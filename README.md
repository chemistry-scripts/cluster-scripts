# Cluster-scripts
A collection of various scripts for submitting computational chemistry jobs to
supercomputing clusters provided by various institutions.

# Occigen
This script collection allows the user to easily setup a working environment
on the OCCIGEN cluster provided by Cines. It provides shortcuts to follow computations
as they are running, follow the queue, and submit Gaussian16, Orca and ADF computations.

# Irene/Skylake
This script collection allows the user to easily setup a working environment
on the Irene cluster provided by TGCC. It provides shortcuts to follow computations 
as they are running, follow the queue, and submit Gaussian16 computations.

# Jean Zay
This script collection allows the user to easily setup a working environment
on the Jean Zay cluster provided by Idris. It provides shortcuts to follow computations
as they are running, follow the queue, and submit Gaussian16 computations.
